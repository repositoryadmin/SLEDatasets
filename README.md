# Benchmark repository for performance evaluation of inertial sensor-based step length estimation models

## Summary

This repository stores datasets for performance evaluation of inertial sensor-based step length estimation models. Researchers are kindly invited to use the data and to contribute their own data and this way encourage the comparability of the evaluation results and simplify benchmarking of new methods.  
  
## Datasets

### [Dataset](dataset/)

Benchmark dataset for performance evaluation of inertial sensor-based step length estimation models. It contains more than 22 km of gait measurements for 15 healthy adults for three walking speeds, four sensor positions typical of smartphone users, and two independent sets of field tests: one for tuning the models' constants and the other one for the performance evaluation of the models.

## Contributions

Researchers are kindly invited to contribute their gait data. To insure the uniformity of different datasets, we kindly ask the contributors to follow some rules when uploading their data:
	
-	Uploaded data should be in JSON format.

-	A folder with the name of the dataset should be created in the root directory, in which the data should be uploaded. In this folder, the data can be organized in the way that is the most convenient for the contributor, but a file containing the summary and organization of the dataset, and the description of the experiment should be included.
	
-	A short summary and a link on dataset should be included in the root README file in the section [Datasets](#Datasets). General information on the number of persons that participated in the experiment, walking speeds and number of sensor position that were tested and walked distances in total should be included.
